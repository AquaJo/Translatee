# Translatee

## Important

This is a modified version of the [official Vencord translation plugin](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord/tree/main/src/plugins/translate). I added myself as an author, but my contribution was minimal. I didn’t collaborate with the original developers; this is just to avoid any confusion. Thanks to the original team for the project!

## What is this?

This is a personalized version of the official plugin intended to add more or less useful features. I might add more stuff in the future and try to keep it updated with the upstream.

To use this modified version feel free checking out the [Vencord Docs](https://docs.vencord.dev/), especially: [this](https://docs.vencord.dev/installing/) and [that](https://docs.vencord.dev/installing/custom-plugins/).\
[`./translatee`](./translatee) is the plugin-folder supposed to land in the `userplugins folder`.

## Features

- Binary translation
  - Choose binary as a "language" (source or target)
  - To get the original text when translating binary instead of Google’s translation on top **:** set `binary` as the target language
